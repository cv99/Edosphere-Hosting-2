<a id="j1"><h2><i>§1 Causes of the American Civil War</i></h2></a>

<p>There were many interesting causes of the American Civil War, and 
although many people would argue that slavery was by far the main issue 
beforehand, there were also many other reasons why such a brutal war occurred. 
A first cause is strongly linked with slavery and is a very significant reason 
that the war begun. This is to do with industrialisation. In the mid-1800s, 
the economies of many northern states had moved away from farming to industry, 
which meant that the demand for slaves was then not so great, and as a result many 
people there favoured a lifestyle free of forced labour. However, the South relied 
heavily upon slaves for their way of life because the slaves helped work the land
for minimal costs. A quick point in relation to the contrast of the North 
and South is that the southern states felt that the federal government was taking away 
their rights and powers, which contributed to the whole idea of a civil war. This also 
led to conflict in Kansas because the government passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1845, 
allowing the residents of Kansas to vote on whether they would have slaves. The state 
was flooded with supporters from both sides and many died as result, although eventually 
the region declared itself a free state (part of the North) in 1861. A third cause was due to the expansion 
of the United States. As its ever-expanding power influence to move westward, each new American state
shifted the balance of power between the North and the South, and the southerners were 
worried that they would lose all their power and their rights. However, the final straw for the South 
was election of Abraham Lincoln as the President of the United States. This is because he was 
elected without being supported anywhere in ten of the southern states.

As a result, the southern states felt that Lincoln was not only against slavery, but also against the South.</p>


<a id="j2"><h2><i>§2 Living in the Civil War</i></h2></a>


<p>Daily life was hard for most in the Civil War; people struggled to survive, 
	with many farmers and lower-class people working even harder just to eat. Most 
	poor men chose to go to war because it seemed more thrilling than toiling hard in 
	the fields back at home, but they quickly found out that it was not only terrifying 
	at times but, in reality, rather boring too. However, the rich tried to avoid the 
	war by, in the North paying a fee of $300+ for someone else to 
	take their place, and in the South by owning more than 
	20 slaves, as you had supposedly proved yourself valuable in a manner which seems horrific in 
	modern days. As with many wars such as <a href="../GCSE-History/ww1">WW1</a> and
	<a href="../GCSE-History/wwii"><WW2></a> 
	women either stayed at home to manage the farm, worked in factories supplying 
		weapons and food for the army, or became nurses, helping the wounded 
		recover and bravely putting their life on the line to do so. Children worked 
		on the army camps and were not supposed to fight until 18, but many did so anyway 
		when the battles begun nearby. Younger children still went to school, but these places 
		became increasingly dangerous as there was much rioting and invasion from both sides. 
		It was an awful time, especially in the south where gruelling starvation and poverty
		led to the tragic deaths of many, even outside the war. Life was very hard as a soldier too. 
		They were woken at dawn to perform drills and between such drills they would do chores
		such as cooking meals, cleaning equipment, and fixing their uniforms,
		not considering the awful prospect of laying down their life on the battlefield.</p>
	

<a id="j3"><h2><i>§3 The Events of the War</i></h2></a>
	

<p>The war began to brew when the Confederation was formed on February 9th, 1861. This was
	when the southern states formed their own country called the Confederate States of America,
	with Jefferson Davis as their president. Just two months later, the Civil War commenced on April 12th,
	1861 as the Southerners attacked Fort Sumter, starting the first battle of the war. This is named
	after the location of the fighting, a small island in South Carolina. 
	In that same month four more states, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas,
	all left the Union (the north) to join the Confederacy. On April 19th, just about a week
	after the start of the war, Abraham Lincoln announced his plan of action. 
	This was the Union Blockade, where the Union Navy would attempt to keep supplies from entering
	or leaving the Confederacy. This blockade forced the Confederacy to ration and reduce
	their supplies. This would of course weaken them later in the war, and perhaps was even
	a significant reason for the North’s eventual victory. For the next year
	there were a series of generally small battles in which both sides lost many men.
	However, some more significant battles included the first and second battles of Bull Run,
	fought near the Bull Run river in North Virginia. The Confederates claimed victory over the North,
	which was more than could be said for the Battle of Hampton Road, between the two ironclad ships,
	the Monitor and Merrimac, the toughest warships at that time on the sea, which ended in a stalemate.
	On January 1st, 1863, in his military capacity (the president could not at the time pass legislation), President Lincoln Ordered for many slaves
	across America to be freed, and this laid foundations for the Thirteenth Amendment, which was a document
	outlining the abolishment of slavery. Lincoln's order was known as the Emancipation Proclamation and, six months later,
	the War was slowly coming to an end as the North won a hugely important victory at Gettysburg, 
	on the 1st of July 1863. The war ended in Spring, 1865 when Robert E. Lee surrendered the last major
	Confederate army to the North at Appomattox Courthouse on April 9, 1865. However, in some sense
	a Union victory was not surprising as <b> PLEASE FIX their army contained 2,100,00 men </b>, roughly twice
	the number fighting for the confederates.</p>
